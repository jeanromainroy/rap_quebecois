It is my life and I'm not changing it\nLet's drink for every dream that I have\nLet's drink for making it\nAnd this is what I'm about and this is who I am\nI got my reasonable doubts I try the best I can\nIt took me a while to understand\nBut every time I held a mic in my hand\nI did it for the fans\n\n[Hook]\nSomehow when time is hard you need to carry on\nWhen you try but it feels like nothing's right\nYou got to keep on going on\nI tell you lean on me like I could lean on you\nYou count on me like I can count on you\nBelieve in your dreams so they believe in you too\nCause this is all we can do\n\n[Verse 2]\nI did so many things I thought that I would never do\nLike playing for 15 thousand people in Moscow\nThink we have some money here? They got some heavy money too\nBelles demoiselles et la Bentley coupe au rendez-vous\nIt is so crazy that I can't help looking back\nI was a wild child homie, can you imagine that\nHow you can change your life just like a game of poker\nIf you haven't seen the river yet the game is not over\nI used do wait for time to pass by\nNow I can't run fast enough for it not to catch me by\nSo I'm gonna tell you one thing you better fight for your dreams\nYou never know, it might be even easier that it seems\nAnd this is what I'm about and this is who I am\nI got my reasonable doubts I try the best I can\nIt took me a while to understand\nBut every time I held a mic in my hand\nI did it for the fans\n\n[Hook]\nSomehow when time is hard you need to carry on\nWhen you try but it feels like nothing's right\nYou got to keep on going on\nI tell you lean on me like I could lean on you\nYou count on me like I can count on you\nBelieve in your dreams so they believe in you too\nCause this is all we can do", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1553716986"}], "artist": "K-maro"}
