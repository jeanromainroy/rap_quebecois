No!\nThe spirit of a soldier, riches of a land\nBut too little to grab on for so many hands\nSo they fight and for a decade they fought again\nI'm watching I'm a kid and god damn I can't understand\nI see the heroes dying, I see the soldiers crying\nI prayed for better days but god was lying so\nThat's my reality I guess, I'm eleven years old and no future to assess\nPlus the fact that I'm a property of a war zone country\nI've seen it all, they made a warrior out of me\nWake up kid it's not your time to go...\nWake up kid it's now the time to show\nThe whole world what you came for, go it's your payback (bis)\nStill so young but living like no tomorrow\nLike on a respirator, breathing on time you borrow\nSeeking for a little piece, a glimpse of sunshine\nGather the family and have some quality time\nAnd then January 1st 1991 war is over\nDaddy had enough, let's move over\nQuickly we pack up, couple of dollars for back up\nGrabbed my little sister, kiss goodbye it's a wrap up\nA new life, for me a new beginning\nI knew from there on there's no fights I won't be winning\nAnd of course I'll be your ultimate hustler I was trained for\nMentally be stronger beat the best and get paid for\nThe world is this kid is scared of nothing'\nNo matter what you showed me I've seen worse\nThe point is I wanna be a leader now\nI was never scared to die, f**k you the world is mine\nWake up kid it's not your time to go...\nWake up kid it's now the time to show\nThe whole world what you came for, go it's your payback (bis)\nNow I never look back I'm just happy I made it\nLife owed me a favour I'm just happy she paid it\nCame from the bottom of bottom straight to the top of the top\nNow I'm enjoying every moment of it like if it was my last\nNow I never look back I'm just happy I made it\nLife owed me a favour I'm just happy she paid it\nCame from the bottom of bottom straight to the top\nOf the top let me sleep if I'm dreaming so they can't take me back", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1553716986"}], "artist": "K-maro"}
