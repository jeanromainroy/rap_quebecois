Or will I catch a stray in my hip\nPlayin ball in the park, when some dude lost with his shits\nOr will the girl that Im with, set me up for a lick\nAnd get my life taken, my future aborted right quick\nIm on the border of insanity, scared to turn the page\nMy momma said its textbook stuff, keep up your grades\nMy city taught me how to hate, my city told me I ain't safe\nMy city made me believe that I could never runaway\nBut this the city where I found myself at...\nAnd I can't help that...\nThey sell traps, you could buy your own jail\nI mean how imma let it pass when they taught me how to fail\nOn my way to victory, give me 2 and a half minutes\nBorn sinnin, our wins was always short winded\nBut I brainstormed a hurricane, to make em all listen\nWhen you grow up in the eye of a storm, everything a limit\nOh I pray for my enemies, on god\nKnow that Im coming for everything, no loss\nSay many money, say many many men\nSay many money, say many men many men\nWish death upon men, - nada no sorry\nImma die fore that bullshit push upon me\nScars on my face, montana, thats tony\nTalked to the mirror he said aye bruh ya owe me\nSet sail these rough waters, the way shit is currently\nI might drown lookin down at the sense of depths urgency\nOne hell of a trip, gonna be one hella of a trip\nDont know where we going but we going, adrift", "image": "https://images.genius.com/df39f8356a1edd2d8d845b64de608deb.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "M.B"}
