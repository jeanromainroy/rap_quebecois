Like my preferred arm\nGot love for the left, but this set of of palms strike quicker than vets from nam\nWhen their breath is gone from napalm in the desert storm\nCombination of elements, take from different wars to complete the penmanship, now forget it bitch\u2026\n\n\n[HOOK - ST]\n\nYou ain't ever heard no shit like this\nYou ain't ever heard no shit like this\nWha-what, wha-what\n\nYou ain't ever heard no shit like this\nYou ain't ever heard no shit like this\nWHAT, WHAT (x2)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/781cb60130788d0349a83d6f0e5d7e85.700x700x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ST x LIAM"}
