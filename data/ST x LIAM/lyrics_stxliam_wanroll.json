I lost my time, never lost my skills\nThey forgot my name, I forgot my ilk\nI was lost in pain, I was lost in space\nI was lost for words, but now I got that shit\nI was off this Earth, saw the cost as worse\nThan I thought I'm worth, but now I got this shit man just wait till I fucking drop this verse\n\n\nNow they wan\u2019 roll?\nIt\u2019s a matter of time before these shows\nNow they wan\u2019 roll?\nWas a matter of time before they\u2019d know\nNow they wan\u2019 roll?\nNow they wan\u2019 roll?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/77b51af47d0213f51bc9dd9ba04c2e15.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ST x LIAM"}
