Where you at?\n\nWell, Liam crashed on his bike\nMeanwhile I crashed in my life\nFuck I went thru some shit\nDamn, disappeared with no sign\nListen here, get close by, cause\nWhen you thinking you got it\nWhen you thinking you got it\nThat's when shit go wild\nHad the soul of a soldier one foot in the grave\nTell me to finish the album\nMeanwhile I wondered if I'd finish the day\nSpending nights spliffin away\nRelationship slippin away\nCause netflix and chilling is good when you feel it\nBut it don't add bricks to your building\nAnd we hit the ceiling, oh we hit the ceiling\nAnd the ceiling was falling like Rome burning out\nLoner in doubt, nowhere in time\nBut now I know where I'm at\nBut now I know where I'm at\nI'm feeling like calling whole universe out\nStronger and proud, a matter of time\nNow I know where I'm at\nNow I know where I'm at", "image": "https://images.genius.com/77b51af47d0213f51bc9dd9ba04c2e15.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ST x LIAM"}
