letter in the alphabet\nFlood down the Rollie, can't see what the time is\nCover that sack like I should've played lineback'\nDrop me a four in the 20, a pineapple\nSnakes on my nigga, think I hear a router\nServin' the junkies, I grew up out back\nSmokin' moonrocks, I'm goin' to NASA\nBands on me like I'm havin' a battle\nSherbet or cookie, it don't even matter\nGet to poppin' pills, you would think I had cancer\nIn the foreign gettin' road head from a dancer\nI'm in designer, made from a panther\nI come in this bitch lit like a candle\n\n[Verse 5: Ness]\nBussdown Roley (ice)\nChampions rings como Kobe\nI be movin' bricks con los homies\nEn un AMG, Gucci on me (gucci gucci)\nTengo lo cuarto, I can\u2019t relax\nEl caro es foreign I press the gas\nEl llero al lado ready to blast\nMe visito designer I get the bag (bag)\nLe dije al combo it would be us\nY ahora boy I'm way up\nLlelo en el cuello (yea)\nEsa modelo quiere free hugss\nBitch you gotta pay up\nNow she wanna team up
