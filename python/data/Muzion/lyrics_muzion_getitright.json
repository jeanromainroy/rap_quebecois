Dramatik he freestyle half the night on the mic\nImpossible hum the baseline melody\nJennifer and me, chilling discussing industry strategy\nHow to build it right, keep the crew tight\nManeuver with foresight and insight\nIn other words just how to get it right\nCan't place the name? What a pity!\nThen check a biblical dictionary under \"ancient holy city\"\nLook for iron, lion, Zion, then add an M.U\nIf you still can't find the line then go buy the debut\nHey you! This Manchilde style is brand new\nMuzion and B-square must be the Fam-Crew\nAnd it's true, yo we stuck like crazy glue\nSo go tell yo mama and yo papa and yo grand too\nShit's gonna be jumping until we gone\nPut the beat on so we can tell you what we on\nBeyond, niggas who ain't got shit to say\nIt was hard yesterday\nBut now we getting paid\nShit's gonna be jumping until we gone\nPut the beat on so we can tell you what we on\nBeyond, niggas who ain't got shit to say\nIt was hard yesterday\nBut now we getting paid", "image": "https://images.genius.com/99cf6575c4685980e839f75de076364d.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Muzion"}
