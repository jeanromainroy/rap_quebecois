I'm a reefer head\nBuy expensive weed and in a week its dead\nSo I seek the bread like a priest seeks a shed\nWhere he can go with a kid\u2026. nahhh, I can't see the rest\n\nI'll let my eyes bleed to death, from this thick smoke\nPanic at the disco fools get hit with that Klitchsko\nIndo packs a heavy punch, so take shit slow\nAnd this is solo, no one will take a drag from my spliff, yo\n\n[VERSE 2 - ST]\n\nSmoking on that high grade I feel the buzz kicking in\nThinking of Romados chicken skin, but my pickings slim\nPlates filling up my kitchen sink options are getting grim\nNeeds start calling I'm going back to how children think\n\nThat's means I'm high dude, munchies at the drive-through\nWhat's really funny is I do this shit all the time too\nLoot thinking shoes getting dirty but gotta eat\nPacking heat in form of weed shit I'm here to inform the streets\n\nSimon got that blowmind, so high, buy it\nThe way I live off grass you'd think I'm on a bovine diet\nShieeet, I stay swift I'm like Stromile flying\nNo dunks on my feet but it's dank in the leaf, listen\n\nI rap about trees, and I smoke to write\nThis bowl ain't rice but my piff brings hope to life\nSo tell me all I do is puff heavy haze\nTold you I roll as well as I rap, so you're fucked anyway\n\n[VERSE 3 - ST]\n\nNow, we all like to categorize\nSo what was your greatest high? The one that shattered your eyes\nWhere you wanted to hide, thc levels would rise\nFunny you got stoned but never felt more alive\n\nShit, my landlord bugging me for the weed smell\nMy drunk neighbour beating his wife but I'm more likely to see jail\nThey got the devil on shelves pumping drinks off retail\nAnd they make me feel like a criminal for my trees, HELP!\n\nI just like to get in the zone, weed helps me tell shit\nSmoke a bit and then just let the man spit\nShit is endless\nCould freestyle for minutes that turn to hours, fuck all my friendships\n\nNever stop, I forever rock\nLike the rock and roll, but the roll don't stop\nThe world don't stop, and the day I go\nWill be the day the spaceships come and everything blows\n\n[VERSE 4 - ST - Overlapping the hook]\n\nYou see the aliens my dude\nThey out here and they flying over you\nBut you really don't know the truth\nCause they haven't told you, you in the mold dude\n\nMindless, you probably one of them dudes\nThat deny any proof from scientists\nHiding behind this, rhetoric that God is good\nAnd that he wouldn't want you to get high, shit\n\nWell guess what, Jesus was smoking weed\nJesus smoking weed, Jesu-Jesus smoking weed\nJesus smoking weed, if he wasn't blowing trees\nHe was high on something else to make them people believe\n\nYou may think I'm rambling, so what if I am\nGrams getting split up in the palm of my hand\nSurvival tactics, my 90s kids should understand\nChillin at the park, rolling weed up in the stands\n\nAt the end, I'm 450gs, you can't seize the crops\nThinking the streets is hot cause you feed your block\nDog, we different, please just stop\nCause I got P's to cop, you just say peace to cops\n\n(Shoutouts)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/781cb60130788d0349a83d6f0e5d7e85.700x700x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ST x LIAM"}
